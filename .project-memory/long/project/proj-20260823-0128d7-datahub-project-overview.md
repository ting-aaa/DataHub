# DataHub project overview

## Purpose

DataHub is a Docker-oriented Rust game configuration management and compilation platform with a Vue 3 web console and PostgreSQL as its canonical database.

## Current State

The public repository exists at https://github.com/ting-aaa/DataHub. The M0 Rust, Vue, PostgreSQL, Nginx, Docker Compose, migration, and CI foundation is implemented and locally verified on feature/m0-foundation. Commit, push, pull request, remote CI, and squash merge into develop remain.

## Product Boundaries

The confirmed v1 direction includes local-account project RBAC, Rust/C#/TypeScript code generation, JSON/CSV/XML/BSON/Protobuf/Lua data output, and cached-value-only handling for imported Excel formulas.
