# DataHub project overview

## Purpose

DataHub is a Docker-oriented Rust game configuration management and compilation platform with a Vue 3 web console and PostgreSQL as its canonical database.

## Current State

The public repository exists at https://github.com/ting-aaa/DataHub. M0-M5 are complete on develop at 2aaf6c8. The free local/Docker gate passes 29 Rust tests, 10 Web tests, six migrations, five application images and end-to-end persistence. M5 adds deterministic revision-pinned manifests, the complete built-in artifact matrix and actual generated-code compilation. M6-M8 remain pending.

## Product Boundaries

The confirmed v1 direction includes local-account project RBAC, Rust/C#/TypeScript code generation, JSON/CSV/XML/BSON/Protobuf/Lua data output, and cached-value-only handling for imported Excel formulas.
